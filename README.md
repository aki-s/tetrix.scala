# Tetrix with scala
### Copy of https://github.com/eed3si9n/tetrix.scala for my study
#### Reason to publish this repository
- Original documentation is a bit hard to track code because of the estrangement between explanation and code,
 so it became hard without version control to develop.
- My tastes of refactor is to be added.
